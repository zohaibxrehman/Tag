The <trees.py> file contains the Tree abstract class and two concrete
implementations of this abstract class. The two implementations are QuadTree and
TwoDTree, which is a kd-tree of dimension 2. These trees are used to store
information of a two dimensional space with points on it. What makes the use
of these trees powerful here is it's efficiency in doing many of the operations.

These data structures have been then used to support different versions
of the Tag game, including Zombie Tag and Elimination Tag.
